<h2> About Me </h2>
<p><img src="MartinKamme.jpg" alt="MartinKamme">I was born in Lund, Sweden and currently live in Encinitas, California. I have had dual citizenship with Sweden and the US since 2013 and have thus been fortunate enough to enjoy growing up in Sweden/California. I have a younger sister who is finishing her undergrad in Biology, following in the footsteps of my mom and dad who work in Medicine and Drug Discovery.
 </p>
<p>This is my second year as a masters student in Aero Astro, concentrating in Guidance Navigation and Control. I am finishing up my final quarter while working for a Remote Sensing company in the Bay called Capella Space.
As a Guidance Navigation and Control engineer I work on a variety of problems regarding how the satellite moves in space and accomplishes its tasks. It is 
a demanding and rewarding position that offers a multitude of opportunities to explore new topics.
